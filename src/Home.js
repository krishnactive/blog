     //the res.ok property is a boolean that indicates whether the HTTP response was successful.
     // It is true if the status code of the response is in the range 200â€“299, which generally signifies a successful response
    //  true if the response status code is between 200 and 299
    // false if the response status code is outside that range (like 404, 500, etc.).
    // if we console res then ok will be shown as a property which is a boolean which tells that response was successfully processed or not
    // if false then we throw a error and will be catched by the .catch property or function
    // instead of console we can also store in a state
    // if we change the api which does't exists then ok will be false // that end point is faulty // that will make request to server, the server will send an error back so ok will be fire and error will be thrown
    // storing the error is some kind of state
    // in return of Home we can do conditional rendering if we have a value for error so again conditional rendering error
